Explination: 

Modified Lexer file for ID's,Integers,boolean values using yylval and each type constructor.

Parser:

Used pseudo bison variables to represent different pointer types in my grammer. Also, created new nodes of each type in my actions using the constructors provided in ast.hpp.I chose constructors based on the arguements that each took and also defined the pointer type of each Non-Terminal as I progressed.
